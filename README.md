It is my Internship project in Yhills, in which I worked on Ubuntu lab and Windows lab for finding vulnerabilities inside the machine. 
In this project, I used ARP scanning tool, msfconsole and Kali linux operating system to perform hacking and also crack password of both machine by using some techniques.
